# HouseHub

A project to consolidate several functions into one, raspberrypi powered home server.

## TODOs

### SpotifySort service

- Add a static IP in the DNS to use instead of localhost for the authentication. Lets us use SSH and open the expected callback in another computer, but not mess up the endpoint response. Will need to update in spotify as well.
