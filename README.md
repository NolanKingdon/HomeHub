# HouseHub

A project to consolidate several functions into one, raspberrypi powered home server.

## TODOs

### General

### SpotifySort service

- Polly retry handling for failed attempts? -> Retrying every hour might fit the bill.
- Unit tests With Autofixture
- - Authentication Flow -> Figure out how to mock classes.
- - Any calls We do (Get playlists, get liked songs, unlike songs, add to playlists, etc.)
- Clean up the code
- Serilog

### Api
- Get unmatched spotify songs
- Authentication for access to Pi?
- Future Arduinos
- Download helper (VPN)
